| **Firing Sequence**,"- When a Server finishes booting, and the Scalarizr Agent was just started."
"| **Scalr Event Actions**||||","- Agent provisions, attaches, formats, and mounts volumes- Orchestration Rule scripts are run- Agent performs a Chef and /or Ansible task if :ref:`chef` or :ref:`ansible` are configured- The Server's status is set to INITIALIZING- The Server's Internal and External IPs are set to the IPs reported by the cloud platform"
"| **When to Use**||","| The HostInit Event should be used to setup actions that are not dependent on the Scalarizr agent, and do not depend on Scalr configuring your Server as specified in the Farm Designer.|| As a general rule, the `BeforeHostUp Event`_ is more appropriate than the HostInit Event for initialization actions.

"| **Flagging Servers as Failed**||||","| Scalr gives you the option to place Servers in Failed State when an Blocking Orchestration Rule triggered by the BeforeHostUp Event fails (i.e. the Script exits with a non-zero exit code). | This allows you to ensure that Servers that failed to initialize properly are placed in Failed State and not in Running State.| When a blocking script failes a HostInitFailed Event is raised and the HostUp Event is not raised.| This option is controlled in the Advanced Tab - Orchestration."
